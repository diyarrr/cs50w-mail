# Description

The Email Client Web App is a single-page web application that provides users with a user-friendly email client experience. Built using Django, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this application fulfills a variety of essential email management tasks, making it a powerful tool for sending, receiving, and organizing emails.


# Key Features:

Send Mail: Users can compose and send emails using a convenient web form. Upon submission, the application sends the email via a POST request to the server, allowing for the seamless transmission of messages.

Mailbox Management: The app includes Inbox, Sent, and Archive mailboxes. Users can easily switch between these mailboxes to view, organize, and manage their emails.

View Email: Clicking on an email opens a dedicated view that displays the sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and email body. Emails are presented in individual boxes, with read and unread emails visually distinguished.

Archive and Unarchive: Users can archive and unarchive received emails, streamlining email organization. Archive buttons are available when viewing Inbox emails, providing efficient management of the inbox.

Reply to Emails: The app allows users to reply to received emails with a single click. The composition form is pre-filled with the original email's sender, subject line, and an appropriate response template.
